- 👋 Hi, I’m @JJayJungleJim
- 👀 I’m interested in AWS serverless computing which lead to an interest in Functional Programming. A top-tier goal is to understand if and how functional programming can be applied to solve routing issue. My current and previous employers use less than stellar software. The overpriced dogwater has resulted in lost time and headaches so it's a great place to start my journey!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Haskell alongside AWS services. I also have books on Rust and Elm. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing really. I currently lack the confidence that I have any compentency to team up with anyone. 
- 📫 How to reach me.
